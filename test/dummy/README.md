# Dummy App

This Rails app exists to validate Recording Studio Web Search in a real host application.

## What It Covers

- Devise authentication with a seeded admin user
- `Current.actor` wiring for Recording Studio events
- Root workspace plus seeded folder and page recordables
- Recording Studio default layout, FlatPack assets, and Tailwind source scanning
- Mounted `RecordingStudio::Engine` route behavior inside a host app
- A signed-in home-page search form that calls `RecordingStudio::WebSearch.search`
- Dummy-only `/docs/*` pages for gem-specific onboarding

## Quick Start

```bash
cd test/dummy
bundle install
bin/rails db:setup
bin/dev
```

Run the commands above from the dummy app directory, not the repository root.

Then open the app and sign in with:

- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `Password`

## Useful Routes

- `/` - signed-in web search demo
- `/recording_studio` - redirects to `/` while the mounted Recording Studio engine stays available under that prefix for non-root routes
- `/users/sign_in` - Devise sign-in page
- `/docs/install`, `/docs/config`, `/docs/recordable_types`, `/docs/recordings_tree`, `/docs/gem_views`, `/docs/methods` - dummy-only starter pages
- `/up` - Rails health check

Authenticated pages use Recording Studio's shared default layout. Devise sign-in keeps `layouts/application`.
